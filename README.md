## How it's made:
<strong> Tech used: </strong> Node.js, Express.js, EJS and MongoDB

It is a simple list app I created to improve my coding skills with Express, EJS and MongoDB. Express is basically a framework for building web applications on top of Node.js. EJS is a template engine for JavaScript. MongoDB is a database where users store information for their websites or applications.

CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete. It is a set of operations users get servers to execute (POST, GET, PUT and DELETE requests). Here is what each operation does:

- Create (POST) - Make something
- Read (GET)- Get something
- Update (PUT) - Change something
- Delete (DELETE)- Remove something

 
## The Lessons I've Learned:

 I made a few typing mistakes that gave me a headache. Then I realized that creating an app is like putting puzzle pieces together. Almost everything is connected.

 Secondly, it's my first time using mongoose and defining schema has made my life easier.
